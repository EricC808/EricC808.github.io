## Introduction

AI nowadays is ued everywhere in education wheter integraetd in class or students are using it for their own personal education, and it has quickly become a staple for most. Especially in Software Engineering developers and programmers are using it every chance they get it's a useful tool that is being utilized daily by them. Since starting college in August of 2023 I have utilized AI as much as I could mainly ChatGPT and recently in my Spring 2025 semseter for ICS 314 I branched out to using GitHub Copilot and DeepSeek. All 3 of these differnt AI are useful and help streamline the process for me in coding as it can be a very long process to make programs. I had the most experince with ChatGPT but in time if found DeepSeek to be more reliable for my coding problems especailly more complex ones taht CHatGPT woulkd get wrong often DeepSeek would be able to spit out the answer i needed in less time.

## Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: Most of the time while doing these I would try my best and start them at first and go as far as I could then use AI to help finish the rest of the assignemnt, but at times if I didn't understand it at all I would start with AI from the start.
2. In-class Practice WODs: Same process with the Experinece WOD's I would start them to the ebst of my ability from the instructions then ask AI to help finish it for me.
3. In-class WODs: The first few WOD's we did i would do most of it by myself then ask AI to finsih and fix my code according to the guidelines reqiured, but then as the semester went on I heavily relied on AI to complete teh whole WOD for me to guarantee i could finish the WOD on time and not get a DNF on my WOD card adn get only 10 out of the 100 points for that WOD.
4. Essays: Every essay i only used ChatGPT to check gramamr and spelling mistakes as i write them staright in GItHUb instead fo somehwer like Google docs that does taht for you already, then for the design pattern essay i ahd it help me brainstorm ideas as i wasn't familiar wiht the concept.
5. Final project: For our Final Project i used a mix of ChatGPT, DeepSeek and GitHub Copilot to compelte and finish all of the coding tasks I was assigned for our project to ensure we would meet the deadlines on time with a completed product.
6. Learning a concept / tutorial: I would only use it to help me get a better understanding of concepts or summarize what was being told if it wasn;t quite clciking for me in my brain.
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord: I would use AI in class at the instruction of my Professor to do so for a discussion, but otherwise I didn't use AI to answer any questions.
8. Asking or answering a smart-question: I never used AI for these as often they were simple questions or a question that AI could not give me the answer I needed, and i barely answered anyone else's questions as I didn't interact much with the smart questiosn channel but when i did it was something AI could not help with or was unnecessary.
9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: I never used AI for giving me coding examples as I never needed them
10. Explaining code: I would occasionally use AI to expalin code if it was complex and I didn't understand the functionallity, but i could understand most simple or normal things
11. Writing code: I used ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and GitHub Copilot all the time to write code as it streamlined the process fo doing so adn was very useful and convenient whether it was for homework or in class assignment I used it.
12. Documenting code: I never asked ChatGPT to document my code during this class as it was often never required or asked, and if it was it was simple documentation that I could do.
13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”: While using AI it was never perfect 100% of the time, so if I got an erro whilst running ro compiling my code I would ask ChatGPt or DeepSeek to resolve my errors.
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I didn't use AI in any differnet way that wasn't listed above.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has definatley helped in my learning experince as the main thing it has done for me was complete things that I could not or do things at a much faster rate than I ever could. 

## Practical Applications

For all coding-related tasks, I used the extension WakaTime in Visual Studio Code. It was easy to set up, was provided as an option in class, and I found it very convenient and simple to use since you don't have to do anything after installing and setting it up. For non-coding tasks, I used my best guess, or if it involved something that tracked time, I would calculate the time from start to finish. I believe most of my actual effort data was very accurate, as WakaTime only tracks when you are actively using Visual Studio Code, which made up most of my actual effort. This eliminated human error in tracking.

## Challenges and Opportunities

There was little to no overhead in tracking my effort during this project. It didn't inhibit my working speed or efficiency at all, as it was either done before I even started working or was very easy to pay attention to and track while doing other tasks.

## Comparative Analysis

My effort estimations were mostly made based on my best guess of how long I felt it would take me on average to complete the task, without really basing it on anything concrete. As I personally haven't had any prior software development experience before this class, I didn't have a good foundation to make accurate or realistic estimations based on my skill level.

## Future Considerations

Pretty much all of my estimations involving coding tasks were inaccurate and inconsistent — it could take me more or less time than I initially estimated. I think the benefit of making effort estimations before doing the actual task is that it gives a rough idea of how much time it might take, allowing me to plan ahead and allocate time or start a few days before the deadline to avoid being rushed while completing my tasks.

## Conclusion

I think the benefit of tracking the actual effort was very helpful for me, as I didn't know how long it would realistically take someone to complete a software development task. Tracking my actual effort gave me at least a small idea of how much time certain tasks generally take. Personally, I don't see any downside to tracking actual effort — it's passive, doesn't actively consume time or energy, and is very helpful and informative in my opinion.
