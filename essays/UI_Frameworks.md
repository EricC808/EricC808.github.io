## Is Bootstrap Really Worth It?

Before this class, I had never heard of or touched TypeScript or JavaScript, so I had a lot of learning to do in just under a week when I was first introduced to it. I was scared at first to learn a new language, as I had only just learned C and the basics of C++ this past semester. But I had a sigh of relief whilst I was going through the TypeScript and JavaScript courses respectively and found out that TypeScript wasn't so bad. I quite liked the fact that in TypeScript, it checks at compile time, similarly to C and C++, which I find to be one of the simple things that are very helpful and save you time.

## Why Not Back to Basics?

If you know anything about web development, you would have heard about HTML and CSS. They are the fundamental building blocks of web pages, but not UI frameworks. UI frameworks like Bootstrap do still use CSS though as a base. Now with this, you might be saying "why not just use CSS then?". Well I'll answer that it's because using UI frameworks such as Boostrap will save you the hassel of writing multiple lines of code to get this one part of your website to the perfect syle that you want. But if you use Bootsrap you turn 10 lines of code in your CSS file, to 1 line of code in your HTML file. 

## Is There Even a Benefit?

I believe that TypeScript is a good language from a software engineering perspective; it's very similar to other languages that you may have learned beforehand, and it also mixes in new helpful things. One of the things I like about TypeScript is how well it integrates with modern development tools, providing features like auto-completion and real-time error checking, which make coding more efficient and enjoyable. These features help catch mistakes early and allow for a smoother development process, especially when working on larger projects where maintainability is crucial. However, I did notice that setting up TypeScript can take some effort compared to JavaScript, with the need for configuration and transpilation. Despite this, I think the added benefits of static typing and improved code reliability make it worth it in the long run. While it might seem like extra work initially, it ultimately helps create more robust and scalable applications, making it a valuable choice for many software engineering projects.
