## The Importance of asking Questions
You can never truly learn if you do not ask questions. Even if something is not 100% in your mind, it does not hurt to ask. I learned from a very young age from my dad that it never hurts to ask, even if they say they cannot answer your question. This is okay because if you did not ask, you would have never known what they would say in response, so it is good that just so you then get the confirmation you need whether or not your question was actually answered. This is the most important thing about asking questions—getting confirmation so you understand what you are being asked or so you can confirm in your brain that you know what you are doing at that moment. However, another important thing about questions is not only just asking to get that confirmation, it is to ask smartly. You may be asking, what is a smart question? Well, a smart question is no basic question; it is one that is clear, concise, and demonstrates effort put forward from the asker on what they truly need help with so they get the best answer possible to their question. This means that there is a proper way to ask and a wrong way to ask. Let’s go over some examples.

## A Smart Question Done Right
When you ask a smart question correctly and put in that effort so you get a high-quality response, your efforts will show as someone responding will understand immediately and efficiently but precisely answer what is being asked. A sign of this on a website like Stack Overflow will be that just from the title, thousands or millions of people will click on your question and read through your post, and you will gain a lot of views on it. The next big sign is the number of upvotes—it will also gain thousands of upvotes due to the contents of the question asked, and with that, many high-quality answers to your question will gradually appear. An example that I found had 3.4 million views, with 13 thousand upvotes and 53 answers. Now why has this post gained so much attention and praise? It is due to the little things that require that extra effort put in from the asker. They first had a short title that summarized their problem/question. Then they asked their question, which was about this certain keyword in Python, and in case people did not know by name, they provided a link to what the keyword's functionality was so more people could understand what was being asked. They also, underneath their question, provided snippets of example code which included a method and a matching caller that they did not understand. Lastly, they finished it off with a more specific question that is still related to the whole main question. This question covers everything that they wish to know and understand. They ask what happens when the method is called, then ask instead what is the output. They asked if it was a list or a single element. However, not all questions on Stack Overflow are asked this way; some are on the opposite end of the spectrum and receive much negative praise and not much attention due to what is asked and how it was asked.

# A Not-So-Smart Question Gone Wrong
Now that we know how to properly ask a smart question and what it looks like, let’s talk about how not to ask a smart question. Now you may be saying, "Oh, that is simple; it is just not doing what you said to do." This is true, but that is not everything that goes into how not to ask a smart question. Asking a question in a not-so-smart way will give you exactly what you put into your question—bad answers or worse, none. If your question is short with not much context or specificity to what you are trying to understand, you will get answers that most likely will not tell you what you are looking for. Often the answers will be, in your mind, completely opposite from what you asked, but from their perspective, they did their best to understand what you are trying to ask and answered the best that they could. This is a major sign that you did not ask your question in a smart way. Another major sign of this is that they respond with more questions, but not the good kind. They might seem a little hostile or frustrating with how they are worded. An example of this that I found on Stack Overflow was a pretty harmless question, you would think, but because of that, it was pointless and useless to ask. They asked how they could optimize their ASCII art with their code pasted and a copy of the output image with them ending it with, "I want to learn how I can make this more efficient. Any and all feedback is welcome." Clearly, this person put no thought into this post and just single-mindedly thought about only what they wanted but did not stop to think if it was possible and if there was any value in doing it. This post has 18 views, with 3 downvotes on it and 2 answers. The answers perfectly show what is wrong with the question asked. The first response asked what they meant by "more efficient," and the way they worded their response, you could tell that they were frustrated with what was asked, with short sentences followed by question marks after each one. The second response was clearly also frustrated. They highlighted the fact that the asker clearly put no thought into their question. They did so by telling that asker that they "need to learn when it is worthwhile to optimize code and when it is just a waste of time." From these examples, it is clear that asking questions the "smart way" is not just about getting answers; it is about fostering meaningful collaboration, saving time, and demonstrating respect for the expertise of others.

# Lessons Learned: How Smart Questions Shape Smarter Developers
Overall, I have learned how I can save myself and everyone time through the process of asking smart questions. It is important to put the effort so your question has that depth and clarity so it is clearly outlined what you are trying to ask and what you are trying to understand. This then enables you to get the proper answer that you are looking for that will clearly explain what you are trying to understand, whether it is short or long. Asking in a smart way not only helps you get better answers, but it also shows that you have respect for the time and knowledge of others who are willing to help. If you do not take the time to properly format your question, you may end up wasting time with answers that do not help, or worse, not getting any at all. But if you put in that little bit of extra effort, you will get responses that are clear, useful, and actually teach you something. In the end, asking questions is not just about getting an answer, it is about growing as a learner and making sure you truly understand what you are trying to learn.
