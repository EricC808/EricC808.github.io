This is a project of mine that I did for my portfolio project in the class AP Computer Science Principles. I made this program in the IDE Scratch which at the time was the best way for me to mkae this idea of mine. This project is baed off of the popular game space invaders with a theme of Star Wars, it involves various interactive elements such as player controls, enemy interactions, etc. I spent hours during and outside of class checking for anything that may cause errors or would not work correctly, so i can confidently say that based off of the requiremnets this program works as intenede with no errors. 

I worked on this project independently, I spent numerous hours brainstorming and implementing my idea. All of the coding was done in Scratch. This program has 4 main functions, one for switching between the title, transistion, gameplay, and end screen. The other 3 are all collision detection, one is for the missle that is shot from the X-Wing and confirms if it has hit a tie fighter. Another one for the tie fighter to see if it has been hit by the missile or it has touched the X-Wing. The last one for X-Wing confirms if it has been touched by the model of the tie fighter and if so go to the end screen and lives go to zero.

From this project I was able to explore Scratch more in depth than how we were taught in class. I learned how to implement screen transistions based off of certain conditions also how to implement basic collision within scartch. This was my first big project so it taught me the importance of debugging and testing in practice versus in concept. This also was my first lesson on effective time managment for developing a coding project, I balanced time in class and outside of class in the 2 week margine that we had to work on this.
